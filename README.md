### Data Analysis with PowerBI

#### Welcome to the Cyclistic bike-share analysis case study In this case study, I will perform many real-world tasks of a junior data analyst. I will work for a fictional company, Cyclistic.

#### As junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The director of marketing believes the companyâ€™s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, my team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently From these insights, my team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic executives must approve my recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations.
